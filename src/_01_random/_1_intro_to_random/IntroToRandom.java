		//4. Now limit the value of num to be between 0 and 100

		//5. Now limit the value of num to be between 25 and 75. Hint: ((highest value - lowest value)+1) + lowest value

		//6. Challenge: Limit the value of num to be between -222 and 88

		//1. Print out the value of num
		
		//2. Run the program.  What number appears in the console?
